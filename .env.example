# === Convex Deploy Keys (Vercel Only - DO NOT set locally) ===
# These are set in Vercel dashboard and determine which Convex deployment
# receives your function deployments during build.

# Production (set in Vercel production environment):
# CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=prod:whimsical-marten-631|<secret>

# Preview (set in Vercel preview environment):
# CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=preview:phaedrus:volume|<secret>

# === CRITICAL: Deployment Architecture ===
#
# Local Development:
#   - Uses CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT (points directly to dev deployment)
#   - No deploy key needed (read-only connection)
#   - Your personal sandbox for testing
#
# Vercel Production:
#   - Uses CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY with "prod:" prefix
#   - Deploys functions to production Convex deployment
#   - NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL auto-updated during build
#   - Production user data lives here
#
# Vercel Preview:
#   - Uses CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY with "preview:" prefix
#   - Auto-creates isolated ephemeral deployment per PR
#   - Separate database from prod and dev
#   - Auto-cleanup after 14 days of inactivity
#
# === WARNING ===
# NEVER mix deployment names with wrong deploy keys!
# The deploy key determines which Convex deployment receives your functions.
# Getting this wrong can cause data to be deployed to the wrong environment.
#
# Example of WRONG configuration (causes data loss):
#   CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:curious-salamander-943  # ❌ Dev name
#   CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=prod:whimsical-marten-631   # ❌ Prod key
#   → Functions deploy to prod, but app connects to dev
#   → Result: App shows empty database
#
# Example of CORRECT configuration:
#   CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=prod:whimsical-marten-631   # ✅ Prod key only
#   → Convex auto-sets NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL during build
#   → Functions and app both use production deployment
