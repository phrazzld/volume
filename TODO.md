# TODO: Unified Dashboard UX Redesign (v1.1)

## Context

**Approach:** Single-page dashboard consolidating logging, history, and stats with zero navigation required. Mobile-first responsive design with inline exercise creation and smart defaults.

**Key Files:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite: unified dashboard page
- `src/components/dashboard/*.tsx` - New component directory for all dashboard components
- `src/components/layout/nav.tsx` - Update navigation (Phase 3)
- `src/app/history/page.tsx` - Delete in Phase 3
- `src/app/log/page.tsx` - Delete in Phase 3

**Patterns to Follow:**
- Form state: `useState` for inputs, refs for auto-focus (see `src/components/sets/log-set-form.tsx`)
- Convex integration: `useQuery` for data fetching, `useMutation` for actions (existing pattern)
- Styling: Tailwind utility classes, dark mode with `dark:` prefix
- Component structure: Controlled components with props interfaces

**Dependencies:**
- lucide-react (installed) - ChevronDown, RotateCcw, Trash2, CheckCircle icons
- Convex queries/mutations (existing) - no backend changes needed
- Existing Tailwind config - will extend with animations in Phase 3

**Critical Path:** Phase 1 (core dashboard) â†’ Phase 2 (smart features) â†’ Phase 3 (cleanup)

---

## Tenet Integration Plan

**ðŸŽ¯ Modularity:**
- Clear component boundaries: DailyStatsCard, QuickLogForm, GroupedSetHistory, SetCard, InlineExerciseCreator, UndoToast
- Single responsibility per component: stats display, form logic, history display, etc.
- Minimal coupling: Parent page fetches data, children receive props
- Interface contracts: TypeScript interfaces for all props

**ðŸŽ¯ Testability:**
- Props-based components (no direct Convex queries in children)
- Pure functions for data transformations (stats calculation, set grouping)
- Controlled form components (testable with mock handlers)
- Test strategy: Start with manual testing, add unit tests for utilities in Phase 4 (future)

**ðŸŽ¯ Design Evolution:**
- Iteration checkpoints:
  - After Phase 1: Review component interfaces, extract emerging patterns
  - After Phase 2: Review auto-focus flow, optimize form UX
  - After Phase 3: Performance audit, identify refactoring opportunities
- Assumptions to validate:
  - Client-side stats calculation is fast enough (< 100ms for 100+ sets)
  - Exercise selector doesn't need search until users have 20+ exercises
  - Inline exercise creation is discoverable enough

**ðŸŽ¯ Automation:**
- Quality gates (already automated): `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`
- Manual validation steps in Phase 3 (not TODO tasks - developer knows to run these)
- Future: Add Playwright E2E tests for critical path (BACKLOG.md)

**ðŸŽ¯ Binding Compliance:**
- hex-domain-purity: Pure functions for stats/grouping logic, UI separate from business logic
- component-isolation: Each component independently developable with clear interfaces
- automated-quality-gates: All commits pass lint/typecheck/build before merge
- code-size: Components stay focused (< 200 lines each), extract utilities if needed

  ```
  Files: src/components/dashboard/daily-stats-card.tsx (new)

  ðŸŽ¯ MODULARITY: Single responsibility - display stats, no mutations
  ðŸŽ¯ TESTABILITY: Pure presentational component, props-based

  Approach: Collapsible card component following TASK.md spec (line 530-610)
  - Props: stats object (totalSets, totalReps, totalVolume, exercisesWorked), expanded bool, onToggle callback
  - Use ChevronDown icon from lucide-react
  - Gradient background (blue-purple), grid layout for stats
  - Handle null stats (empty state)

  Time: 30 minutes
  ```

- [ ] Implement SetCard component
  ```
  Files: src/components/dashboard/set-card.tsx (new)

  ðŸŽ¯ MODULARITY: Presentational only, actions via callbacks
  ðŸŽ¯ TESTABILITY: Props-based, no side effects

  Approach: Individual set display card following TASK.md spec (line 1130-1180)
  - Props: set object, exercise object (optional), onRepeat callback, onDelete callback
  - Use RotateCcw and Trash2 icons from lucide-react
  - Relative time formatting ("2h ago", "Just now", "Yesterday at 3pm")
  - Confirm dialog on delete
  - Hover states for action buttons

  Success: Displays set info, formats time correctly, repeat/delete buttons work, looks good in dark mode
  Time: 45 minutes
  ```

- [ ] Implement GroupedSetHistory component
  ```
  Files: src/components/dashboard/grouped-set-history.tsx (new)

  ðŸŽ¯ MODULARITY: Container for SetCard components, handles grouping display
  ðŸŽ¯ TESTABILITY: Receives pre-grouped data as props

  Approach: Day-grouped set list following TASK.md spec (line 1020-1070)
  - Props: groupedSets array (date, displayDate, sets[]), exercises array, onRepeat callback, onDelete callback
  - Map over groups, render day headers with emoji ðŸ“…
  - Render SetCard for each set in group
  - Empty state: Friendly message with ðŸ’ª emoji

  Success: Groups display correctly, day labels format nicely, empty state shows, actions work
  Time: 30 minutes
  ```

- [ ] Implement QuickLogForm component (basic version, no smart features)
  ```
  Files: src/components/dashboard/quick-log-form.tsx (new)

  ðŸŽ¯ MODULARITY: Form logic isolated, controlled inputs
  ðŸŽ¯ TESTABILITY: Callbacks for mutations, form state testable

  Approach: Logging form following TASK.md spec (line 640-800), Phase 1 features only
  - Props: exercises array, onSetLogged callback (optional)
  - State: selectedExerciseId, reps, weight, isSubmitting
  - Use Convex useMutation for logSet
  - Validation: required exercise/reps, reps > 0

  ðŸŽ¯ MODULARITY: Pure functions, no side effects
  ðŸŽ¯ TESTABILITY: Easy to unit test with sample data
  ðŸŽ¯ BINDING COMPLIANCE: hex-domain-purity - business logic separate from UI

  Approach: Extract pure functions for reuse following TASK.md spec (line 195-255)
  - calculateDailyStats(sets): Filters today's sets, calculates totals
  - groupSetsByDay(sets): Groups into Map<dateString, sets[]>, sorts by date
  - formatDateGroup(dateString): Returns "Today", "Yesterday", or formatted date
  - formatRelativeTime(timestamp): Returns "2h ago", "Just now", etc.

  Success: Functions work correctly, handle edge cases (empty arrays, null), pure (no mutations)
  Time: 30 minutes
  ```

- [ ] Rewrite home page with unified dashboard
  ```
  Files: src/app/page.tsx (complete rewrite)

  ðŸŽ¯ MODULARITY: Page orchestrates components, doesn't implement logic
  ðŸŽ¯ TESTABILITY: Data fetching layer separate from presentation

  - Use Convex useQuery for sets and exercises
  - Use useMemo for dailyStats calculation (from dashboard-utils)
  - Use useMemo for groupedSets (from dashboard-utils)
  - State: statsExpanded (boolean, default true)
  - Render: DailyStatsCard â†’ QuickLogForm â†’ GroupedSetHistory
  - Handle loading states (undefined queries)
  - Handle delete set (useMutation, pass to GroupedSetHistory)
  - Handle repeat set (callback to pre-fill form) - Phase 2

  Layout:
  - Max-width container (max-w-4xl)
  - Vertical spacing (mb-6 between sections)
  - Mobile padding (px-4), responsive (sm:px-6 lg:px-8)

  Success: Page loads, data fetches, components render, stats calculate correctly, can log sets and see them appear
  Time: 1 hour

  Time: 30 minutes
  ```

- [ ] Implement "Repeat Last Set" functionality
  ```
  Files: src/components/dashboard/quick-log-form.tsx (modify), src/app/page.tsx (modify)

  ðŸŽ¯ MODULARITY: Clear data flow from parent to form

  Approach: Pre-fill form from set data
  - Add prop to QuickLogForm: onRepeatRequest (optional callback to get last set)
  - Add "Repeat Last" button to form (next to Log Set button)
  - Button enabled only if last set exists for selected exercise
  - onClick: Pre-fill reps and weight from last set
  - Auto-focus reps input for quick edit

  In page.tsx:
  - Track lastLoggedSet state
  - Pass to QuickLogForm
  - Also wire up onRepeat from SetCard â†’ pre-fills from specific set

  Success: Repeat button pre-fills form correctly, works from both button and set cards, focus flows to reps
  Time: 45 minutes
  ```

- [ ] Add auto-focus flow to QuickLogForm
  ```
  Files: src/components/dashboard/quick-log-form.tsx (modify)

  ðŸŽ¯ DESIGN EVOLUTION: Optimize keyboard/mobile flow based on testing

  Approach: Intelligent auto-focus following TASK.md spec (line 688-707)
  - Add refs: exerciseRef, repsRef, weightRef
  - useEffect: When selectedExerciseId changes â†’ focus reps
  - handleRepsKeyDown: Enter â†’ focus weight (or submit if weight empty)
  - handleWeightKeyDown: Enter â†’ submit form
  - After submit success â†’ focus exercise selector (for quick re-logging)

  Success: Selecting exercise focuses reps, Enter in reps focuses weight, Enter in weight submits, flow feels natural
  Time: 30 minutes
  ```

- [ ] Implement UndoToast component
  ```
  Files: src/components/dashboard/undo-toast.tsx (new)

  ðŸŽ¯ MODULARITY: Self-contained toast with timer logic

  - After logSet success: show toast, store setId
  - onUndo: Call deleteSet mutation, hide toast
  - onDismiss: Hide toast, clear setId

  Success: Toast shows after logging, undo deletes the set, auto-dismiss works
  Time: 20 minutes
  ```

- [ ] Add exercise sorting by recency
  ```
  Files: src/app/page.tsx (modify)

  ðŸŽ¯ DESIGN EVOLUTION: Smart defaults based on usage patterns

  Approach: Sort exercises by last usage following TASK.md spec (line 234-255)
  - Use useMemo: exercisesByRecency
  - Build Map of exerciseId â†’ last used timestamp from sets
  - Sort: most recently used first, then alphabetical
  - Pass exercisesByRecency to QuickLogForm instead of exercises

  Success: Most recent exercises appear first in dropdown, unused exercises at bottom alphabetically
  Time: 20 minutes
  ```

## Phase 3: Polish & Cleanup [2-3 hours]

**Goal:** Remove old code, add animations, final polish.

- [ ] Add slide-up animation to Tailwind config
  ```
  Files: tailwind.config.ts (modify)

  ðŸŽ¯ AUTOMATION: Reusable animation utilities

  Approach: Add keyframes and animation following TASK.md pattern (line 1220-1230)

  - Add to theme.extend.animation: "slide-up": "slide-up 0.2s ease-out"
  - Apply to UndoToast component

  Success: Toast slides up smoothly when appearing
  Time: 10 minutes
  ```

- [ ] Add expand/collapse animation to DailyStatsCard
  ```
  Files: src/components/dashboard/daily-stats-card.tsx (modify)

  Approach: Smooth height transition

  Time: 30 minutes
  ```

- [ ] Add empty state for no exercises
  ```
  Files: src/app/page.tsx (modify)

  ðŸŽ¯ DESIGN EVOLUTION: Better first-run experience

  Approach: Detect empty exercises array, show friendly prompt
  - If exercises.length === 0: Hide form, show creation prompt
  - Large ðŸ’ª emoji, heading "No exercises yet"
  - Prominent "+ Create your first exercise" button â†’ shows InlineExerciseCreator

  Success: Empty state looks good, guides user to create first exercise
  Time: 20 minutes

- [ ] Manual cross-browser and responsive testing
  ```
  Context: This is a validation step, not a TODO task. Listed for completeness.

  Test in: Chrome, Safari, Firefox
  Test on: Desktop (>1024px), tablet (640-1024px), mobile (<640px)
  Test: All interactions, dark mode, keyboard nav, touch targets

  See TASK.md line 1515-1550 for full checklist.
  ```

## Quality Validation (Reference - Not TODO Tasks)

**Before commits:**
- Run `pnpm typecheck` - TypeScript compiles without errors
- Run `pnpm lint` - ESLint passes
- Run `pnpm build` - Production build succeeds
- Manual smoke test - Core workflow works (log a set, see it appear)

**ðŸŽ¯ Tenet Compliance:**
- **Modularity:** Each component has single responsibility, clear interface
- **Testability:** Components are props-based, data transformations are pure functions
- **Design Evolution:** Refactoring opportunities documented in code comments
- **Automation:** Quality gates run automatically (lint, typecheck, build)
- **Binding Compliance:**
  - hex-domain-purity âœ“ (pure utils in lib/, UI separate)
  - component-isolation âœ“ (props-based, independently testable)
  - automated-quality-gates âœ“ (pnpm scripts)
  - code-size âœ“ (components stay focused, < 200 lines)

**Metrics to Track:**
- Bundle size: Should stay < 120 kB (currently ~105 kB)
- Component sizes: Each < 200 lines (extract if larger)
- Zero circular dependencies
- TypeScript strict mode: No errors

---

## Design Iteration Checkpoints

**ðŸŽ¯ DESIGN NEVER DONE** - Schedule reviews after each phase:

**After Phase 1:**
- Review component interfaces - are props clean and minimal?
- Check for code duplication - extract common patterns?
- Validate data flow - is parent-child relationship clear?
- Test on real mobile device - any UX issues?

**After Phase 2:**
- Review auto-focus flow - does it feel natural or annoying?
- Check exercise sorting - is recency useful or confusing?
- Validate inline creator - is it discoverable enough?
- Test repeat functionality - works as expected?

**After Phase 3:**
- Performance audit - any slow renders? (React DevTools Profiler)
- Bundle size check - under 120 kB?
- Accessibility audit - keyboard nav works? Screen reader friendly?
- Identify technical debt - document in code comments for future

---

## Next Steps After TODO.md Complete

1. Run `/execute` to start Phase 1 implementation
2. After Phase 1: Manual testing, review, iterate
3. After Phase 2: More testing, refine UX
4. After Phase 3: Create PR with `/git-pr`
