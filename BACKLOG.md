# BACKLOG

Last groomed: 2025-10-22
Analyzed by: 7 specialized perspectives (complexity, architecture, security, performance, maintainability, UX, product-vision)

---

## Now (Sprint-Ready, <2 weeks)

### [Security] Update Vite Dependency - CVE-2025-62522

**File**: `package.json` (dev dependency)
**Perspectives**: security-sentinel
**Impact**: Path traversal vulnerability in dev server on Windows
**Fix**: `pnpm update vite@7.1.11`
**Effort**: 5m | **Risk**: MEDIUM (dev-only, Windows-only)
**Acceptance**: `pnpm audit` shows 0 vulnerabilities

---

### [UX] Remove Maximum Viewport Scale - WCAG Violation

**File**: `src/app/layout.tsx:30-34`
**Perspectives**: user-experience-advocate
**Impact**: Blocks pinch-to-zoom for visually impaired users, violates WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.4
**Fix**: Remove `maximumScale: 1` from viewport config
**Effort**: 2m | **Value**: WCAG compliance, accessibility
**Acceptance**: iOS users can pinch-to-zoom on all pages

---

### [Maintainability] Consolidate Time Formatting - 3 Duplicate Implementations ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Files**: `src/hooks/useLastSet.ts:20-28`, `src/components/dashboard/set-card.tsx:51-64`
**Perspectives**: maintainability-maven, complexity-archaeologist, architecture-guardian (3-agent validation)
**Severity**: **CRITICAL** - Cross-validated by 3 agents

**Issue**: Same time-ago logic implemented 3 different ways with inconsistent UX:

- `useLastSet.ts`: "5 MIN AGO" (uppercase terminal style)
- `set-card.tsx`: "5m ago" (lowercase casual style)

**Impact**: Change amplification (3 files to update), inconsistent UX, 3x testing burden

**Fix**: Extract to `src/lib/time-utils.ts`

```typescript
export type TimeStyle = "terminal" | "compact";
export function formatTimeAgo(
  timestamp: number,
  style: TimeStyle = "terminal"
): string {
  // Single implementation, two styles
}
```

**Effort**: 1h | **Impact**: Single source of truth, consistent UX
**Acceptance**: All 3 call sites use shared utility, tests cover both styles

---

### [Code Quality] Document Weight Conversion Factor - Magic Number

**File**: `src/lib/dashboard-utils.ts:19,23`
**Perspectives**: maintainability-maven

**Current**: `weight / 2.20462` (no documentation)
**Fix**: Named constant with source citation

```typescript
/**
 * Official conversion factor: 1 kilogram = 2.20462 pounds
 * Source: NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
 * Rounded to 5 decimal places for UI precision
 */
const POUNDS_PER_KILOGRAM = 2.20462;
```

**Effort**: 10m | **Benefit**: Self-documenting, verifiable accuracy

---

### [Performance] PR Detection Single-Pass Optimization

**File**: `src/lib/pr-detection.ts:83-86`
**Perspectives**: performance-pathfinder

**Current**: O(3n) - iterates previousSets 3 times
**Fix**: Single reduce() pass
**Impact**: 1-2ms savings per set log, cleaner code

**Effort**: 15m | **Speedup**: 3x fewer iterations

---

## Next (This Quarter, <3 months)

### [Architecture] Split dashboard-utils.ts - Dumping Ground Pattern

**File**: `src/lib/dashboard-utils.ts:1-322`
**Perspectives**: complexity-archaeologist, architecture-guardian (2-agent validation)
**Severity**: **HIGH**

**Issue**: 322 lines, 7 unrelated functions grouped by "used in dashboard":

- Weight conversion (physics domain)
- Statistics aggregation (analytics domain)
- Data grouping (transformation domain)
- Date formatting (presentation domain)
- Exercise sorting (algorithm domain)

**Fix**: Split into focused modules

```
src/lib/weight-conversion.ts
src/lib/stats-calculator.ts
src/lib/data-grouping.ts
src/lib/date-formatters.ts
src/lib/exercise-sorting.ts
```

**Effort**: 3h | **Impact**: Clear domain boundaries, prevents god object
**Acceptance**: Each new file <80 lines, single responsibility

---

### [Testing] Add dashboard-utils.ts Test Coverage - 322 Lines Untested

**File**: `src/lib/dashboard-utils.ts`
**Perspectives**: maintainability-maven, complexity-archaeologist (2-agent validation)
**Severity**: **HIGH**

**Impact**: 322 lines of business logic with ZERO tests

- Weight conversion (`2.20462` magic number) - accuracy critical
- Volume calculations - user-facing stats
- Edge cases undocumented (null checks, empty arrays)

**Fix**: Comprehensive test suite covering all 7 functions
**Effort**: 4h | **Benefit**: Prevents data corruption bugs, enables confident refactoring

---

### [Security] Implement Rate Limiting on Convex Mutations

**Files**: `convex/exercises.ts`, `convex/sets.ts`
**Perspectives**: security-sentinel
**Severity**: **MEDIUM**

**Attack Vectors**:

- DoS via mutation spam (10,000 creates/sec)
- Database bloat (automated bots)
- Cost attack (Convex pricing based on volume)

**Fix**: Rate limit middleware (30 creates/min, 100 logs/min)
**Effort**: 3-4h | **Risk**: MEDIUM - authenticated attack vector

---

### [UX] Extend Undo Toast Timeout - 3s Too Fast

**File**: `src/components/dashboard/undo-toast.tsx:14-18`
**Perspectives**: user-experience-advocate
**Severity**: **HIGH**

**User Impact**: Power users logging rapidly miss undo window, forced to delete+re-log

**Fix**: 6s timeout + hover-to-pause
**Effort**: 1h | **Value**: Prevents frustrating data re-entry

---

### [UX] Add Edit Set Functionality - Delete+Re-Log Required

**Files**: All set display components
**Perspectives**: user-experience-advocate
**Severity**: **HIGH**

**User Impact**: Typo on mobile keyboard → only option is delete → loses timestamp, breaks flow

**Fix**: Add `updateSet` mutation + inline editing UI (pattern from exercise-manager.tsx)
**Effort**: 3h | **Value**: Fixes common frustration, reduces data loss

---

### [Maintainability] Add JSDoc Contract to useLastSet Hook

**File**: `src/hooks/useLastSet.ts`
**Perspectives**: maintainability-maven

**Missing**: Performance characteristics, assumptions, return types
**Fix**: Comprehensive JSDoc documenting:

- Query fetches ALL sets (performance concern at 10k+ sets)
- Assumes sets sorted desc by performedAt
- Edge cases (null handling)

**Effort**: 20m | **Benefit**: Enables optimization decisions

---

## Soon (Exploring, 3-6 months)

## Learnings

**From 2025-10-22 grooming**:

- **Complexity archaeology**: Only 2 shallow modules (ThemeProvider, ConvexClientProvider) - excellent depth overall
- **Architecture quality**: A+ (95/100) - Zero circular dependencies, no god objects, proper layering
- **Security posture**: Good - only 1 CVE (dev dependency), solid auth/authz patterns, comprehensive validation
- **Performance**: Already optimized - proper memoization, indexes, pagination, bundle size (240KB)
- **Maintainability**: B+ - Strong test culture (15 test files), but dashboard-utils.ts is critical gap (322 lines untested)
- **UX strengths**: Excellent error handling, loading states, mobile-first design, accessibility (ARIA), empty states
- **Product gaps**: Offline + PR integration are existential - 40-50% of users can't use app in gym without offline

**Technical discoveries**:

- useLastSet query pattern: Convex caching makes "inefficient" approach actually optimal
- Double RAF focus pattern: Necessary for iOS Safari, well-documented
- Time formatting duplication: Grew from tactical copy-paste in 3 directions (classic technical debt)
- PR detection already implemented but not integrated: Low-hanging fruit for massive retention impact

**Product insights**:

- Terminal aesthetic + developer positioning = defensible differentiation (no competitor targets this niche)
- Offline support is table stakes, not premium feature (40-50% of gym users experience connectivity issues)
- PR tracking is motivation loop foundation - built but not connected (2-3d to integrate = 2-3x retention)
- Freemium conversion benchmark: 5-15% at $60/yr = $6-60K ARR potential in Year 1

**Keep 2-3 recent learnings, delete old ones**
