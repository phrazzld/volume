## Decision Log

### Why These Aren't in MVP
- **Analytics**: Requires data aggregation strategy, not critical for first use
- **Offline-first**: Convex has good optimistic updates, true offline is complex
- **Export/Import**: Trust-builder but not launch blocker
- **Advanced UI**: Keypad/RPE/notes add polish but core flow works without them
- **PWA features**: Installability is nice but web app works fine
- **Sessions**: Organization layer on top of sets, not required initially

### Prioritization Criteria
1. **User Value**: Does this solve a real user problem?
2. **Simplicity**: Can we ship simpler version first?
3. **Risk**: What's likelihood of failure/scope creep?
4. **Dependencies**: What must exist before this?

### Future Architecture Decisions Needed
- When to add Dexie? (User complaints about offline)
- When to go native? (Widget requests, HealthKit demand)
- When to add auth complexity? (Coach sharing, social)
- How to handle scale? (1M+ sets per user)

---

## How to Use This Backlog

1. **After MVP launch**: Gather user feedback, measure usage patterns
2. **Prioritize**: Pick items that solve real user problems (not cool tech)
3. **Batch**: Group related items into coherent releases (v1.1, v1.2, etc.)
4. **Iterate**: Ship small, measure impact, adjust priorities

**Remember:** The best feature is the one users actually need, not the one that's technically impressive.
